# 🏦 Loan Prediction Model
This repository contains a Machine Learning model that predicts whether a loan application is likely to be approved based on various applicant features such as income, credit history, loan amount, and more.

## 📌 Objective
The primary goal is to automate the loan eligibility process by leveraging historical data and machine learning algorithms to predict loan approval outcomes.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used contains features such as:
- Gender
- Married
- Dependents
- Education
- Self_Employed
- ApplicantIncome
- CoapplicantIncome
- LoanAmount
- Loan_Amount_Term
- Credit_History
- Property_Area
- Loan_Status (Target)

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- Modeling: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- Evaluation: Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, Cross-Validation

## 📊 Workflow
1. Data Collection & Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering & Encoding
4. Model Building & Evaluation
5. Hyperparameter Tuning
6. Final Model Selection

## 📈 Results
- Achieved an accuracy of **X%** using Random Forest after fine-tuning.
- Logistic Regression and Decision Tree were also evaluated for performance comparison.
*(Replace X% with actual accuracy)*
